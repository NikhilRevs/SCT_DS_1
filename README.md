# 📊 Population Data Visualization Project

## 🔍 About
This project is designed to introduce learners to data visualization by analyzing real-world population data. Participants will learn how to use bar charts and histograms to represent distributions of age or gender within a population. It is ideal for beginners in data analytics or anyone exploring exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📝 Task 01 - Age Distribution Visualization

**Objective:**  
Create a **bar chart** or **histogram** to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable — specifically, the age distribution of India's population in 2022.

### Sample Dataset
A dataset (provided in CSV/Excel format) includes population breakdowns by age groups. The data can be visualized to show:
- Number of people aged **0–20 years**
- Number of people aged **21–64 years**
- Number of people aged **65+ years**

Refer to the sample chart based on:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- OR Excel/Google Sheets

### Example (Python Code Snippet)
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("sample_dataset.csv")

# Plot
df.plot(kind='bar', x='Age Group', y='Population', color='skyblue')
plt.title("India's Population by Age Group (2022)")
plt.ylabel("Population (in millions)")
plt.xlabel("Age Group")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
